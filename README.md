# BoozeTEK
Capstone Project

This was my capstone project for my assiciates degree.  
BoozeTEK was created as a drink resource for people to figure out how bartenders make their favorite drinks.

Based off of the selection of the different types of Alchohol and Mixers, BoozeTEK will query an SQL database and show how many different drinks can be made with the components selected.  There is also a search bar that will find different drinks by name or drinks that contain a specific ingredient (ex. gin, vodka, etc.)

Returning users can login to see their saved "Virtual Bar" for quick drink references.

Admins can login and add new drink recipies and ingredients.  They can also setup and maintain user accounts.

BoozeTEK was created using ASPX and SQL.  My team and I also utilized JQuery, Javascript, and custom CSS in order to shape the site and have clean functionality.  

I was personally responsible for creating and maintaing the SQL database tables, the stored procedures, and recipe creations.  I also coded the carousels on the front end, and the search bar functionality.  

I can provide a zipped file with the entire project upon request, complete with the SQL scripts and documentation.
